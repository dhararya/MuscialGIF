This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The project is also deployed on [https://www.gifii.fun](https://www.gifii.fun)

## What the project actually does

1. Upon entering the homepage, the user is able to type in a custom caption.
2. Based on the caption, the project uses the GIPHY API to render a random but relevant GIF.
3. A sound is randomly chosen to pair with the GIF.
4. The user can then generate a custom link to share with friends and family of their creation.
